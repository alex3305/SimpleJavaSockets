Simple socket implementation in Java

Since I couldn't find any good, simple solution for a multi-threaded socket implementation for Java, 
I, with some help from StackOverflow and users on Gathering of Tweakers (Woy, Herko_ter_Horst), I 
made this quite simple implementation of sockets.

This project contains a Maven project with three modules:
* Server: Multi-threaded socket server that currently echo's a simple message.
* Client: Client that goes with the server and reads input from a CLI.
* Shared: Shared code, which is currently only the base class for sending byte arrays over sockets.

This code is ready to go, but has to be modified to suit your own needs. You can, for example, make
a simple client-server chat client or a remote file browser. With the ability to send byte arrays it
is even possible to send files or binary data over the network.
